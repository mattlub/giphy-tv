# giphy TV
giphy TV is the (provisional) name for my simple web app which allows you to add random
gifs from a search tag to a TV display, ending up with a customised, endlessly repeating
tiled gif viewing experience. I know. Wow.

Check it out [here](https://mattlub.github.io/giphy-tv/)

### Motivations
I love gifs, randomness, and using good API's. This project seemed only natural.

### Current Stage
It functions basically and looks quite nice. Gotta slicken the functionality though.

### Planned improvements/further ideas
- [ ] responsive (v. important)
- [ ] store id's of gifs
- [ ] share button
- [ ] title/logo/branding
- [ ] fit gifs better within frames (centered etc.?)
- [ ] restrict max number of gifs (dependent on screen size etc.)

### Collaboration
Very welcome.
