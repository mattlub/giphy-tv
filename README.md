# giphy TV
giphy TV allows you to add random gifs selected by search tag to your own personal customised, endlessly repeating, tiled gif-viewing experience. I know. Wow.

Check it out [here](https://mattlub.github.io/giphy-tv/)

### Motivations
I love gifs, randomness, and using good API's. This project seemed only natural.

### Current Stage
It functions basically and looks quite nice.

### Planned improvements/further ideas
- [ ] responsive (v. important)
- [ ] store id's of gifs
- [ ] share button
- [ ] title/logo/branding
- [ ] fit gifs better within frames (centered etc.?)
- [ ] restrict max number of gifs (dependent on screen size etc.)
- [ ] improve performance e.g. by using small gif sizes

### Collaboration
Very welcome.
